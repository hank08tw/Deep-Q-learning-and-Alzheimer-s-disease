# Deep-Q-learning-and-Alzheimer's-disease
In this project, we create a deep Q learning model to imitate and compare the path walked by Alzheimer's patient and the path generated by model.
If you want to train and run the model, first create a python virtual environment then activate it, then install tensorflow and kera. Then revise the parameters in qmaze_general.py and run python3 qmaze_general.py to train the model and show the path walked by model.

If you want to walk the maze in virtual reality, make sure to prepare VR helmet and two hand controllers, use unity to open testmaze directory and run.
