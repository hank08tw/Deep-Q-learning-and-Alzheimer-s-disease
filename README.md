# Deep-Q-learning-and-Alzheimer's-disease
In this project, we create a deep Q learning model to imitate and compare the path walked by Alzheimer's patient and the path generated by model.
If you want to train and run the model, first create a python virtual environment then activate it, then install tensorflow and kera. Then revise the parameters in qmaze_general.py and run python3 qmaze_general.py to train the model and show the path walked by model.
